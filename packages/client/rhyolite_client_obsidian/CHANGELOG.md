**Sign in with a code when the browser cannot bring you back.**
Browser sign-in finishes by handing an `obsidian://` link back to the app, and
not every desktop delivers it — Linux most of all. The code skips that step:
open the sign-in page, copy the code it shows, paste it into Obsidian. Same
account, same session.

### Features

- sign in by pasting a code when the browser cannot come back (obsidian)

### Other

- a cut transfer reports the failure, not an empty result (core)

## [3.17.2] - 2026-09-05

**Moving or renaming a file costs no download on your other devices.**
The change travels as one piece, and the content is rebuilt from the copy
already on disk. A 27 MB attachment moved to another folder arrives in seconds
and transfers nothing.

**The status dot and the sync panel always show the same thing.**
One state and one palette drive both, so pausing, losing the connection and
repairing storage read the same wherever you look at them.

### Bug Fixes

- moving or renaming a file no longer re-downloads it elsewhere (core)
- the status dot and the panel agree, colours included (obsidian)
- the recovery notice says what recovery actually does (obsidian)
- storage checks tell an unreachable backend from an empty one (core)
- background storage checks wait for the network to come back (core)
- the sync log says where transferred content came from (core)

## [3.17.1] - 2026-09-04

**A sync that finished stays finished.**
Files a device already holds are recognised before anything is fetched, so
reaching the end of a sync no longer costs a second pass over the whole vault.
A download interrupted part way keeps the ground it covered instead of
returning to the beginning.

**Returning to Obsidian no longer interrupts a running sync.**
Bringing the window back to the front while sync is starting up leaves the
transfer alone to finish.

**Content missing from storage is repaired from the vault itself.**
A file whose stored copy has gone missing is re-uploaded from the one on disk
rather than only reported.

### Bug Fixes

- returning to the window no longer restarts a running sync (obsidian)
- a sync that finished no longer starts over (core)

## [3.17.0] - 2026-09-03

**Sync no longer stops because the local database filled up.**
The plugin was keeping a second copy of every attachment in its own database,
beside the file already on disk. It does not any more, and a database that
already holds those copies gives the space back on the next launch. Storage
now reports its own size, and offers to shrink the file when most of it has
gone empty.

**A large download no longer runs the database out of room.**
Chunks on their way to a file are held in memory and written once, as the
file, instead of passing through the local database first. A pull of several
gigabytes now costs what the files cost, and a download interrupted halfway
keeps every file it had already finished.

**The status says what is actually happening.**
One indicator for the whole plugin, notes and settings together. It no longer
reads "up to date" while files are still going out, and it stops flickering
between states on a slow backend — an open transfer is enough to say the work
is not finished. Progress counts files, which is what you can see, rather than
the pieces they arrive in.

**A large upload stops waiting on its biggest file.**
Files are grouped by size, so one video no longer holds a dozen photos that
finished minutes ago, and each file leaves the transfer list when its own
bytes are up rather than when its neighbours are.

**Your own storage cannot stall the whole sync.**
A transfer to external storage that stops answering is cut and retried instead
of being waited on indefinitely, so one unreachable file no longer holds
everything behind it.

**A device that reconnects stops going deaf.**
Change notifications re-attach to the live connection instead of retrying the
one that dropped, so a device keeps learning about other devices' edits after
a network blip.

### Features

- the local database has a ceiling, and reaching it is handled (core)
- the tiles say what they know, and the database gets a home (obsidian)
- stop writing a change feed nobody reads, and offer the space back (obsidian)
- give back the megabytes a delete only freed inside the file (obsidian)
- a command that says what fills the local database (obsidian)

- a record refused by the local clock stops being lost forever (core)
- "the vault forces nothing" and "we never found out" stop being the same value (core)
- drop the domain copies my own verification restored (core)

### Refactoring

- the palette keeps verbs, not a copy of a hub's contents (obsidian)
- one rule for "is anything working", tested by behaviour (obsidian)
- every startup phase is timed by the same three lines (core)
- the startup pass comes out of start(), in two pieces (core)
- one call points the engine at the auth it now has (obsidian)
- the engine graph is built by a function a test can call (obsidian)
- the database open becomes a phase, and the fallback gets run (obsidian)
- the first boot phase leaves bin/ and gets tested (obsidian)
- one mutable global left, and a test that keeps it that way (obsidian)
- the recovery ladder folds its own events (obsidian)
- the plan gets an object, not four globals (obsidian)
- the session names what it needs, so teardown can be tested (obsidian)
- one slot for what a load owns, not twenty (obsidian)
- the host probes move where they can be named (obsidian)
- the pipeline is assembled in one place, once (core)
- the blob backend, its hub and its id key become one object (core)
- the domain is a declared dependency, not an ambient one (core)
- the rules about time move out of the store that reads the clock (core)
- a device's choice of what to sync is not a rule about how things converge (core)
- the blob format and the merge vocabulary were never the store's (core)
- the domain tests move with the domain, and the move stops half-done (core)
- the domain moves into a package that cannot reach a runtime (core)

## [3.16.3] - 2026-09-01

**A large first sync is several times faster.**
Notes upload in groups instead of one at a time, and content this device
already holds is no longer fetched back from the server. A vault of a few
hundred notes over your own storage finishes in seconds.

**Your own storage is treated as yours alone.**
A backend that cannot be reached is never replaced with the managed one. A
refused password is named, a rate limit is waited out, and a server hiccup is
retried — each gets the answer it deserves instead of a silent failure.

**A long first sync is left to finish.**
A device busy uploading keeps its session, so a pass that needs several
minutes gets them, and what it has already sent survives an interruption.

### Bug Fixes

- a storage that refuses this device says so instead of syncing silently (core)
- an unknown storage backend is refused, not guessed as managed (core)
- external storage is proved before it is called connected (obsidian)
- a throttled storage backend is waited out, not counted as a failure (core)
- a 5xx blip on a storage backend is retried, not counted as a lost file (core)
- a busy engine is no longer mistaken for a dead one (obsidian)
- a busy engine is not restarted for going quiet (obsidian)
- the connection probe gets room when the engine is busy (obsidian)
- re-arm the connection before ever restarting the engine (obsidian)
- a restore no longer kills settings sync with a null check (obsidian)
- settings sync starts once per session again (obsidian)
- serialise the local database, which cannot take two writers (core)
- a dead session ends the pass, and it ends for every worker (core)
- the push goes out in batches instead of one impossible call (core)
- a vault with unsent files stops calling itself finished (core)
- a stopped engine still reports the numbers it last had (core)
- states are published while the upload is still running (core)
- the startup scan reports where it has got to (core)
- re-uploading to a new storage is its own pass, not the verify one (core)
- the startup scan stops drowning the log it is written into (core)
- the pull stops drowning the log it is written into (core)

### Performance

- the startup pass groups notes the way it already grouped binaries (core)
- a note stops fetching its own blob on every reconcile (core)
- a device stops fetching back the records it just pushed (core)
- a tracked binary is skipped on its stat instead of re-read (core)
- the push examines what changed, not the whole vault (core)

### Other

- connecting an external storage says what it leaves behind (obsidian)

## [3.16.2] - 2026-08-31

**A large first sync now finishes on its own.**
A batch that fails is carried past instead of ending the whole pass, and a sync
that is still making progress is no longer given up on after a fixed number of
attempts. A vault that needs several sessions to upload completes across them
without anything being pressed.

### Bug Fixes

- a first sync that is making progress is not given up on (obsidian)
- one bad upload group no longer ends the whole first sync (core)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.16.2 (obsidian)

## [3.16.1] - 2026-08-31

**An interrupted first sync keeps what it already uploaded.**
Files are recorded as each batch completes, so a sync that stops part-way
resumes from there instead of beginning the vault again. A large vault now
finishes across as many sessions as it needs.

**A vault owned by another account is reported instead of retried.** Sync stops
and says so, rather than repeating a sign-in that cannot change the answer.

### Bug Fixes

- not owning a vault stops sync instead of looping on refresh (obsidian)
- a start superseded during the connect stops there (core)
- a disposed transfer hub stops spraying unhandled errors (core)
- a failed first sync keeps the files it already uploaded (core)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.16.1 (obsidian)

## [3.16.0] - 2026-08-31

**A bug report reaches support in one press.**
It carries the plugin version, vault statistics and this device's recent logs,
and comes back with a short number to quote. Note and folder names are replaced
with pseudonyms before anything leaves the device, and nothing you wrote in a
note is included. A copy stays in your vault.

**Sync makes fewer round trips.** Notes and attachments transfer in batches
rather than one exchange each, and a large transfer names the file it is
moving. Notes no longer keep a second copy in the local cache, and a launch
sends only what the server does not already have.

### Features

- raise the report cap to a size that should never be reached (account)
- send the report to support instead of asking for a file (obsidian)
- a contract for handing a diagnostic report to support (account)
- the report is an archive of the log files, not one document (obsidian)
- a diagnostic report is never synced, whatever the filters say (core)
- logs kept by segment, and a way to delete them (obsidian)
- a bug report the user can hand to support (obsidian)
- a log declares its paths and urls rather than spelling them out (core)
- a re-upload says which large file it is sending (core)
- a pull says which large file it is fetching (core)

### Bug Fixes

- the bug-report copy describes what the report now does (obsidian)
- a preempted pull keeps the batches it already applied (core)
- a restart no longer re-pushes every file this device authored (core)
- startup progress counts files again, not upload groups (core)
- a start that lands on a running start supersedes it, quietly (core)
- the small indicator stops going green mid-sync (obsidian)
- a pull asked for during startup no longer races the startup pull (core)
- the engine states when it is busy instead of leaving the UI to guess (core)
- the engine says it is connected when the socket is up, not 49s later (core)
- settings sync survives an engine restart it did not order (obsidian)
- an upload batch is not cancelled out from under a caller who rejoined (core)
- re-upload confirmation says what it does to the other devices (obsidian)
- restore from server no longer deletes files it cannot bring back (core)

### Refactoring

- a settings scan names what it skipped once, not every time (obsidian)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.16.0 (obsidian)
- per-file data moves off the global meta row, lazily (core)
- a startup upload group costs two round trips, not two per file (core)
- overlap the prefetch groups again — batching alone was a regression (core)
- a pull batch costs two round trips, not two per file (core)
- budget the remaining loop yields; leave the pre-flight ones alone (core)
- yield on a time budget, not on an item count (core)
- the post-pull sweep costs what changed, not the whole vault (core)
- a pull sweeps the cache it just filled, instead of leaving it a day (core)
- pin the byte-stability a note's blob recovery now depends on (core)
- say why a note's blob needs no local copy, in the right order (core)
- a note's blob is never cached, instead of cached and swept later (core)
- a note's blob leaves the local cache, like an attachment's (core)
- a note's CRDT tree is stored in the compact encoding, not JSON (core)

## [3.15.5] - 2026-08-28

**A database error now tells you what actually went wrong.**
When something went wrong writing to the local database, the sync panel showed
"cannot rollback - no transaction is active" — a message about the cleanup, not
about the failure. The real cause (the disk being full, a storage error from the
device) was discarded on the way out. It is now the one you see.

Writes to the local database are also genuinely atomic for the first time. A
batch that failed part-way used to leave everything it had already written in
place; it now leaves the database as it found it.

### Bug Fixes

- a database error reports what actually went wrong (core)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.15.5 (obsidian)

## [3.15.4] - 2026-08-28

**A plugin reload now leaves one plugin behind, and keeps its database.**
Connecting a vault, switching to self-host and resetting the local database all
reload the plugin. The instance being replaced now releases everything it held:
its entry in Settings, its sync indicator, and its handle on the local database.

Until now it released none of that. Each reload left an extra "Rhyolite Sync" in
Settings and an extra sync circle in the status bar, and the database handle it
kept locked the next instance out of durable storage — sync fell back to memory,
which is lost when Obsidian closes, so the vault downloaded again on every
launch. Toggling the plugin off and on, or reinstalling it, added another copy
rather than clearing them; fully quitting Obsidian was the only way back.

### Bug Fixes

- a plugin reload releases the instance it replaced (obsidian)
- a reload replaces the plugin instead of adding a second copy (obsidian)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.15.4 (obsidian)

## [3.15.3] - 2026-08-28

**The plugin now says when your subscription has ended.**
A plan that lapses puts your vault back on free-tier limits, and uploads above
the free storage quota stop going through. The sync panel and Settings now show
that, with the date and a way to renew — and give you a heads-up in the week
before a plan ends.

### Features

- say when a subscription has ended, where the effect is felt (obsidian)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.15.3 (obsidian)

## [3.15.2] - 2026-08-28

**Plugin sync only transfers what you don't already have.**
Plugins installed on your device are recognised as current before anything is
fetched, so only genuine updates come down. Restoring settings from the server
on an up-to-date vault now takes about a second.

Plugin sync also holds steady on a slow connection: your plan is remembered
between sessions, so a momentary lookup failure no longer interrupts it.

### Bug Fixes

- a plugin already on disk is verified, not downloaded again (core)
- a plan lookup that times out no longer re-downloads every plugin (obsidian)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.15.2 (obsidian)

## [3.15.1] - 2026-08-27

**Resume no longer takes a minute, and no longer looks like it did nothing.**
Pausing and then resuming could leave sync idle for over a minute, with the
panel still reading "Sync stopped" the whole time. The button looked broken,
and the natural next move — press it again, or restart Obsidian — was the one
that helped least.

Two separate things caused that. Settings sync and note sync share one queue
that runs a single job at a time, and a settings download already under way
could not be interrupted: it kept the queue to itself until it gave up a
minute later, and the resume waited behind it. Pausing now cancels that
download outright. Separately, the panel had nothing to say between the click
and the engine actually starting, so it kept showing the state from before the
pause; it now says "Connecting..." from the moment you press it.

Both also apply when sync restarts on its own — after waking from sleep, or
when the connection is re-established.

### Bug Fixes

- resume says it is working instead of looking ignored (obsidian)
- a settings pull no longer holds the only scheduler slot through a pause (core)
- a paused sync stops settings work instead of letting it finish (core)
- a start nobody is waiting for gets out of the way (core)
- let a failed body read be caught like every other HTTP failure (core)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.15.1 (obsidian)


## [3.15.0] - 2026-08-27

**Sync now tells you why it is not running.** Signed out, no vault chosen, a
passphrase never entered, a server address left blank — all four used to read
the same way: a grey "Sync stopped / Not connected", which looks exactly like
the service being down. There was nothing to press and nothing to go on.

Each of them now says what is missing and carries the button that fixes it:
Sign in, Connect vault, Unlock, Settings. Signing in from the panel is the
same one-click browser login the settings tab offers. If sync cannot start
when Obsidian opens, you get one notice saying so; the panel opens only when
you ask it to.

**The sync panel stopped disappearing after a restart.** If the panel was open
when Obsidian closed, reopening it often showed "This plugin is no longer
active" — and the plugin was missing from Settings for the first seconds too.
Obsidian rebuilds your layout as soon as plugins finish loading, and this one
was still waiting: on your click in a vault or passphrase dialog, or on a slow
network. It now claims its place in the sidebar before any of that, and both
dialogs open after startup instead of holding it up.

**A restart is no longer mistaken for a logout.** Settings could greet a
signed-in user with a Sign in button, and Connect vault would then do nothing
at all. Access passes are short-lived and get renewed in the background; the
plugin was reading "the pass expired a minute ago" as "this person is signed
out".

When a session really has ended, that is now acted on once, plainly: you are
signed out and asked to sign in. Previously nothing drew that conclusion, so
sync retried an account it could never reach — a panel stuck on "Connecting…",
and a startup that felt slow because every retry waited on the same doomed
renewal.

**Connecting a vault no longer re-downloads it on the next launch.** A vault
connected from Settings was stored under the previous session's name, so the
following start found nothing and pulled the entire vault down again. Nothing
was ever lost, and vaults connected before this update are unaffected.

**The plugin speaks your language on a phone.** A Russian Obsidian on iPhone
showed an English plugin. The language was only ever read from an explicit
choice in Obsidian's settings — and someone whose phone is already Russian
never makes that choice, because Obsidian follows the system. It now follows
the system too. Picking a language by hand still wins over everything.

**Version history opens for any file, not just the one in front of you.**
History is kept per path, so renaming a note starts a new history under the
new name — and the versions written under the old name had no way to be
opened at all, the same as for a note you deleted. There is now a list of
every path with history, with a filter and a marker on the ones that are gone.

**Questions and answers, one click away.** A help button in the sync panel and
at the top of Settings, open whether or not you are signed in. It opens a new
page covering what this sync does differently — empty notes, conflicts,
deletions, renames — since most "is it broken?" moments turn out to be
habits from another plugin.

### Features

- say why sync isn't running, and put the sign-in button in the panel (obsidian)
- open the history of any path, not just the open note (obsidian)
- reach the questions-and-answers page from the panel and settings (obsidian)

### Bug Fixes

- stop the sidebar panel from vanishing after an Obsidian restart (obsidian)
- a cold start is not a logout (obsidian)
- a refused refresh token now signs you out instead of retrying forever (obsidian)
- connecting a vault from settings no longer costs a full re-download (obsidian)
- follow Obsidian's language on a phone, not only an explicit choice (obsidian)

## [3.14.2] - 2026-08-22

**Properties with an emoji stopped breaking.** A note whose `status` or
`priority` holds an emoji could come back with the following line glued onto
it and an unrenderable box where the emoji had been:

```
priority: 🇦?category:
  - "[[work]]"
```

3.14.1 fixed one cause of scrambled properties. This was a second, separate
one, which is why it could still happen after updating — and it is the reason
the damage always landed on an emoji rather than anywhere else.

Editing text stores the change by position. Emoji are counted as one character
almost everywhere, but as two in the format the comparison step works in, and
two emoji that look unrelated often share their first half — the coloured
squares do, the letter symbols do. When a change fell exactly there, the
position came out one off: the newline after the emoji was removed instead of
the emoji itself, and half a character was stored in its place.

Nothing needs to be done differently; edits at emoji are now counted the way
the rest of the note is. Notes already damaged stay as they are, and the
version from before the damage is in the file's history.

### Bug Fixes

- an edit next to an emoji no longer removes the following line break and
  stores a broken character (core)

### Other

- bump plugin to 3.14.2 (obsidian)


## [3.14.1] - 2026-08-21

**Properties no longer come back scrambled.** Change the same property on two
devices — a date, a status, anything Templater or the Linter rewrites on every
save — and the two values could be merged letter by letter instead of one of
them winning. `category` came back as `catgeory`, a timestamp as
`2026-08-121T11:23:01`. It took one device's copy of the note being in an
older form for this to happen, which is why it found the vaults that had
already had trouble once.

Properties now merge one key at a time whatever form the other device's copy
is in, and "Repair sync state" no longer causes it — it used to strip the
typed properties from every note in the vault as it went. Notes already
scrambled stay that way; the version from before the merge is in the file's
history.

**A vault you already had on a new device is no longer replaced.** Install
Rhyolite on a machine that already holds a copy of the vault, and any note
whose content differed was overwritten by the server's version on the first
sync, with nothing left to recover it from. Both versions are now kept and
merged.

**Settings and plugins sync faster.** Every settings file and every plugin
used to go up on its own — one request each, and a plugin's files one after
another — so the wait grew with how many things you had rather than with how
much had actually changed. A scan now sends everything it found in a single
request, and a plugin's files transfer together. The difference shows where it
was worst: the first sync on a new device, turning plugin sync back on, and
"Re-upload from this device".

**An emptied list property keeps its type.** Clear a list — `aliases`,
`tags`, `category` — and letting Obsidian rewrite the note turned the property
from a list into plain text, so it stopped behaving like a list everywhere
else.

### Bug Fixes

- properties merge per key even when the other device's copy carries no typed
  frontmatter, instead of blending both values character by character (core)
- "Repair sync state" keeps typed properties instead of stripping them from
  every note (core)
- a first sync no longer overwrites a note the device already had and had
  never synced (core)
- an emptied list property is no longer silently turned into text (core)

### Other

## [3.14.0] - 2026-08-08

**Stray "Untitled" notes no longer appear on your other devices.** Creating a
note and naming it is two steps — Obsidian makes it as "Untitled", you type
the name — and if the first step reached your storage before the second, the
throwaway name was left behind on every other device with no way to notice.
The upload had to still be running when you renamed, so this hit hardest
where uploads are slowest: your own S3 or WebDAV, mobile connections, large
notes. Existing strays clear themselves the next time the name is reused.

**Rhyolite now asks about files that disappeared while it was off.** Delete
something with sync paused, or with Obsidian closed, and nothing was
watching: the deletion never reached your other devices, and worse, it lay in
wait — the moment another device edited that file, the two collided and the
file came back. The sync panel now lists these and asks, with "Delete on all
devices" and "Keep them".

It asks rather than decides, and that is deliberate. A vault that failed to
mount looks exactly like a folder you emptied, and there is no way to tell
them apart from here — so the wrong guess would delete your notes everywhere.
Only files this device actually held are listed; anything it simply never
downloaded, or that your folder filter excludes, is not a candidate.

**Faster uploads to your own storage.** A directory check meant for WebDAV was
being repeated before every upload, and on a remote backend the round trip is
most of the cost. Measured on a real vault, upload times stopped climbing —
they had been growing edit over edit, up to nineteen seconds for a short note.

### Bug Fixes

- a file removed while its upload was still running is no longer published
  under the old name (core)

### Other

## [3.13.3] - 2026-08-08

Fixes a way the copy kept of a losing version could be discarded too early.

When the same attachment is changed on two devices at once, Rhyolite keeps
both: the newer one stays in place and the other is saved beside it as a
conflict copy. Since 3.13.0 an attachment already present in your vault is
no longer also held inside the plugin — and while a file was in that
unresolved state, that rule was being applied to *every* version of it,
including the one not on disk. The version that lost could lose its local
copy before it had been written out.

Now nothing belonging to a file in conflict is dropped until the conflict is
resolved. Worth updating if you edit attachments on more than one device.

The "Choose folders…" buttons are gone; the folder filters are typed in
directly, as the file-type list already was.

They were aimed at the wrong half of the problem. What made folder filtering
tedious elsewhere is having to name every folder you do *not* want — and
naming the one or two you *do* was never the hard part. Meanwhile the picker
listed only folders present on this device, which meant it omitted exactly
the ones you had excluded earlier: you could narrow the filter through it and
never widen it again.

Anything already chosen keeps working. Folder names are matched ignoring
case, and stray slashes or spaces around them do not matter.

## [3.13.1] - 2026-08-08

The Local database card that 3.13.0 added to Storage overview is gone again.
It reported what the plugin's file cache weighs, and that figure turned out
not to be comparable to anything else on the screen: your plugin set counts
in it but not in the vault size beside it, and a note appears in one as its
text and in the other as the editing history that merges it. There was also
nothing to do about the number — that storage is cleaned automatically. A
figure nobody can read or act on is worse than no figure.

What 3.13.0 actually changed about disk use is still in place: an attachment
is no longer kept twice, once in your vault and once inside the plugin. Only
the counter went away.

### Bug Fixes

- a file saved by a newer version of Rhyolite is now listed under "Needs a
  newer version" instead of being retried silently on every sync, so a note
  that never arrives says why (core)
- that notice now says what to do about it, rather than leaving you to infer
  it (obsidian)

## [3.13.0] - 2026-08-07

Choose which folders this device syncs. The only filter so far was by file
type, so putting one folder on a phone meant naming every folder you did not
want. Now you name the ones you do — from a picker that lists your vault's
folders with their file counts, or by typing them — and you can punch a hole
in that: sync `Work`, skip `Work/scratch`.

The filter belongs to the device, not the vault. Nothing about it reaches the
server or your other devices, and leaving a folder out is not a delete — those
files stay on disk, stay on the server, and keep syncing everywhere else. Add
a folder back and its files arrive on the next sync.

Attachments no longer take up twice the space. Each one was kept twice on the
device: once as the file in your vault, once inside the plugin's own database.
The second copy is now dropped once the first is in place, so a vault that is
mostly attachments roughly halves what the plugin occupies. Notes keep theirs,
because what is stored for a note is its editing history — the thing that makes
conflict-free merging possible in the first place. Storage overview has a new
Local database card showing the split.

Settings say who they apply to. The file-type and folder filters are yours
alone; the "sync as whole files" list is shared with every device you sync.
Those sat under one heading with nothing to tell them apart, and now sit under
two that say which is which. The file-type list moved to an explicit Save
along the way, since applying either filter restarts sync.

### Features

- sync only the folders you choose on this device, with an optional list of
  folders to skip inside them (obsidian)
- see what the plugin itself occupies on this device, split between notes and
  attachments, in Storage overview (obsidian)
- reclaim unreferenced files from your own S3 or WebDAV storage: your device
  lists the bucket, the server decides what is safe to remove (core)
- restore a file the server has lost from the copy already in your vault, not
  only from the plugin's cache (core)

### Bug Fixes

- a vault on your own storage no longer reports itself as managed after a
  restart, and no longer applies the managed plan's per-file size limit to
  storage that plan does not govern (obsidian)
- WebDAV: recreate the vault folder and retry when the server reports it
  missing, instead of failing the upload (core)
- stop re-sending a directory-creation request to S3, which has no directories
  (core)

## [3.12.0] - 2026-08-04

Properties now merge as data. Until now a note was merged character by
character from end to end — right for prose, and blind to the one rule
frontmatter has: a property name may appear only once. Two devices adding the
same property at the same time each contributed their line, and the note ended
up carrying the key twice. That is valid YAML, so nothing looked broken, and
Properties, Dataview and every other reader quietly showed half the data.

Both devices need 3.12 for the new merge. Against a device still on an older
version the previous behaviour applies, and no property is lost either way.

### Features

- merge properties by name, so two devices adding the same one at the same time
  end up with a single property holding both values (core)
- leave a file alone when it was written by a newer version of Rhyolite, and
  list it in the sync panel, instead of writing its internal form into the note
  (core)

### Bug Fixes

- resolve a conflict between two independently created notes without
  duplicating the properties of either (core)

### Other

- reclaim deleted properties once every device has seen the deletion (core)

### Other

- bump plugin version to 3.4.1 (obsidian)


## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-14

### Vaults

- Deleting a vault now removes all of it from the server. Your notes were already cleared, but a vault's synced settings were left behind; a permanent delete now removes everything (obsidian, core).
- A vault you delete on one device now disappears from your other devices too. A connected device that sees the vault was deleted elsewhere disconnects and clears its local sync state — your note files on disk are left untouched (obsidian, core).


## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Settings sync

- Settings now sync the moment you switch away from Obsidian and when you close the settings dialog, not only when you return to it. A setting you change on one device reaches the others right away (obsidian).


## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Sign-in & account

- Sign in through your browser. Signing in now opens the website, you authenticate there, and the session is handed back to the plugin — the same single sign-in method used by the Telegram bot. Sign-in opens in your real browser rather than an in-app window (obsidian, account).
- Manage your subscription on the website. Subscribing and plan management open the account page already signed in as you, instead of a separate in-plugin payment screen (obsidian, account).

### Vaults

- Delete a vault from the vault picker. This permanently removes that vault's data from the server — files, history, and blobs — while leaving your local note files on disk untouched. Deletion requires typing the vault name to confirm (obsidian, core, account).
- The vault picker hides "Create vault" once you have reached your plan's vault limit (obsidian).

### Settings sync

- Settings no longer re-sync when a device merely reformats a JSON settings file. Plugin settings are now compared by their canonical content, so a different key order or indentation on another device no longer triggers a needless sync (core, obsidian).
- When settings arrive from another device, the plugin prompts you to reload so they take effect (obsidian).


## [3.1.2] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Downloaded file data is now verified against its content hash before it is written, so a corrupted download or a damaged local cache can no longer silently corrupt a note — the affected file is re-fetched and repairs itself automatically (core).


## [3.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Updated the conflict-free text-sync engine with correctness fixes to the Fugue merge algorithm (convergent 0.6.0) (core).


## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Conflict-free text sync

- Text notes now merge with a true conflict-free algorithm (Fugue CRDT). When the same note is edited on two devices at the same time, both sets of edits are combined into one file — no conflict copies, no lost keystrokes (core).
- Large edits and full-file rewrites merge predictably: the diff is bounded by a deadline, so a big paste or bulk find-replace no longer stalls typing or drops characters (core).

### Storage management

- New storage overview shows how much space your synced vault and settings occupy, with a refresh control (obsidian).
- "Reclaim orphaned blobs" removes server data no longer referenced by any file (obsidian, core).
- Storage cleanup can now clear all synced history, not just history older than N days (obsidian, core).
- Cleanup and blob-delete failures are surfaced instead of failing silently (obsidian, core).

### Devices

- New device management view: list the devices syncing this vault and forget ones you no longer use (obsidian, core).

### File history

- History browser now shows a git-style line diff between versions, with a scrollable version list and back navigation (obsidian, core).
- Restoring an older version writes the real file content again (it could previously restore raw internal data) (core).

### Sync panel & transfers

- New docked sync side panel with a single unified pause/resume control (obsidian).
- Live per-file transfer progress and an active-transfers monitor, so large uploads and downloads show real movement (obsidian, core).
- Sync reconnects automatically when the network comes back (obsidian).

### Large files

- Files above your plan's per-file size limit are skipped cleanly before chunking instead of freezing the app, and are picked up automatically once they're within the limit (obsidian, core).
- Chunking is cooperative, so importing or editing very large files no longer freezes the interface (core).

### Reliability

- Engine startup is atomic — a failed start no longer leaves a half-running sync behind (core).
- A failed pull is retried instead of skipping that file forever, and sync no longer converges on data that isn't available yet (core).
- Every version is preserved in a three-or-more-way conflict (core).
- Settings sync no longer echoes its own writes, reformats unchanged files, or syncs device-specific workspace layout (obsidian).
- Remembered vault keys are verified on boot, and external-storage config is encrypted per vault (obsidian).

### Removed

- The in-plugin log viewer was removed (obsidian).


## [3.0.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Filenames whose characters have more than one Unicode form — accented Latin or Cyrillic letters like «й»/«ё» — no longer sync as phantom duplicates between macOS/iOS and other platforms. Paths are normalized (NFC) so the same file keeps a single identity across devices instead of churning forever (core).


## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-06
