// The invariant was written down for the gRPC path and never applied to the
// HTTP one, so on BYO storage a stalled response hung its group, the group
// hung its batch, and the batch hung the pull: one fetch of five blobs
// produced no completion for six minutes while every other file waited.
//
// Idle rather than total, because slow is not the same as dead — the same
// vault legitimately spent 278 seconds on five multi-megabyte blobs.
